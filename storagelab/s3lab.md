# **Storage on AWS Hands on Labs**

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. This lab is designed to demonstrate how to interact with S3 to store, view, move and delete objects.

## **Create a Bucket in S3**

Every object in Amazon S3 is stored in a bucket. Before you can store data in Amazon S3 you must create a bucket.

_Note: You are not charged for creating a bucket; you are only charged for storing objects in the bucket and for transferring objects in and out of the bucket._
