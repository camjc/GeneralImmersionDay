# **AWS General Immersion Day**

In this introductory session, through a mix of classroom training and hands-on labs, you will learn about AWS foundational services as well as key concepts for AWS security measures and architecture best practices.  In this session you will:

- Learn how to leverage AWS Services to design, deploy, and operate on the AWS cloud
- Understand AWS architecture best practices for building and managing cloud solutions
- Get hands-on experience with core AWS services like EC2, S3, and VPC

## **Pre-Requisites**

### **AWS Account**

In order to complete this workshop, you'll need an AWS account and access to create AWS resources within that account.

The code and instructions in this workshop assume only one participant is using a given AWS account at a time. If you attempt sharing an account with another participant, you will encounter naming conflicts for certain resources. You can work around this by either using a suffix in your resource names or using distinct Regions, but the instructions do not provide details on the changes required to make this work.

Use a personal account or create a new AWS account for this workshop rather than using an organization's account to ensure you have full access to the necessary services and to ensure you do not leave behind any resources from the workshop.

### **Tools**

To complete parts of the workshop and some challenge tasks, you will need these tools installed on your workstations:

* ssh (MacOS / Linux)
* Putty (Windows)
* Windows Remote Desktop Client
* MySQL Client / MySQL Workbench (Windows)
* AWS CLI (Optional) - See [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) to install and configure the AWS CLI.
